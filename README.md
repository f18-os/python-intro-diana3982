# Lab 1: Python Intro

The file wordCount.py takes in a command input from the user,

`$ python wordCount.py <input file name> <output file name>`
then will read thru the input file and count the number of instances of a specific word. The words and number are stored into a dictionary which will be used to create an output file of the results from the countWords function.
